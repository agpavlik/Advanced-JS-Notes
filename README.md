### JS FOUNDATION <a name="1"></a>

### ðŸ“’ Javascript Engine <a name="2"></a>

A `JavaScript engine` is a computer program that you give JavaScript code to and it tells the computer how to execute it. Basically a translator for the computer between JavaScript and a language that the computer understands.

There are many JavaScript Engines out there and typically they are created by web browser vendors. All engines are standardized by `ECMA Script` or `ES`.

`Parsing` is the process of analyzing the source code, checking it for errors, and breaking it up into parts.

The parser produces a data structure called the `Abstract Syntax Tree` or `AST`. AST is a tree graph of the source code that does not show every detail of the original syntax, but contains structural or content-related details. Certain things are implicit in the tree and do not need to be shown, hence the title abstract.

An `interpreter` directly executes each line of code line by line, without requiring them to be compiled into a machine language program. Interpreters can use different strategies to increase performance. They can parse the source code and execute it immediately, translate it into more efficient machine code, execute precompiled code made by a compiler, or some combination of these.

The `compiler` works ahead of time to convert instructions into a machine-code or lower-level form so that they can be read and executed by a computer. It runs all of the code and tries to figure out what the code does and then compiles it down into another language that is easier for the computer to read.

`Babel` (https://babeljs.io/) is a Javascript compiler that takes your modern JS code and returns browser compatible JS (older JS code). `Typescript` (https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a superset of Javascript that compiles down to Javascript. Both of these do exactly what compilers do. Take one language and convert into a different one!

In modern engines, the interpreter starts reading the code line by line while the profiler watches for frequently used code and flags then passes is to the compiler to be optimized.

In the end, the JavaScript engine takes the bytecode the interpreter outputs and mixes in the optimized code the compiler outputs and then gives that to the computer. This is called `"Just in Time"` or `JIT` Compiler.

### ðŸ“’ Writing Optimized Code <a name="3"></a>

`Memoization` is a way to cache a return value of a function based on its parameters. This makes the function that takes a long time run much faster after one execution. If the parameter changes, it will still have to reevaluate the function.

```javascript
// Bad Way
function addTo80(n) {
  console.log('long time...')
  return n + 80
}

addTo80(5)
addTo80(5)
addTo80(5)

// long time... 85
// long time... 85
// long time... 85

// Memoized Way
functions memoizedAddTo80() {
  let cache = {}
  return function(n) { // closure to access cache obj
    if (n in cache) {
      return cache[n]
    } else {
      console.log('long time...')
      cache[n] = n + 80
      return cache[n]
    }
  }
}
const memoized = memoizedAddTo80()

console.log('1.', memoized(5))
console.log('2.', memoized(5))
console.log('3.', memoized(5))
console.log('4.', memoized(10))

// long time...
// 1. 85
// 2. 85
// 3. 85
// long time...
// 4. 90
```

### ðŸ“’ Call Stack and Memory Heap <a name="4"></a>

The JavaScript engine does a lot of work for us, but 2 of the biggest jobs are reading and executing it. We need a place to store and write our data and a place to keep track line by line of what's executing.
That's where the call stack and the memory heap come in.

The `memory heap` is a place to store and write information so that we can use our memory appropriately. It is a place to allocate, use, and remove memory as needed. Think of it as a storage room of boxes that are unordered.

The `call stack` keeps track of where we are in the code, so we can run the program in order.

### ðŸ“’ Stack Overflow <a name="5"></a>

So what happens if you keep calling functions that are nested inside each other? When this happens it's called a **stack overflow**.

```javascript
// When a function calls itself,
// it is called RECURSION
function inception() {
  inception();
}

inception();
// returns Uncaught RangeError:
// Maximum call stack size exceeded
```

### ðŸ“’ Garbage Collection <a name="6"></a>

JavaScript is a garbage collected language. If you allocate memory inside of a function, JavaScript will automatically remove it from the memory heap when the function is done being called.
However, that does not mean you can forget about `memory leaks`. No system is perfect, so it is important to always remember memory management. JavaScript completes garbage collection with a `mark` and `sweep` method.

### ðŸ“’ JavaScript Runtime <a name="7"></a>

When you visit a web page, you run a browser to do so (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Each browser has its own version of `JavaScript Runtime` with a set of `Web API's`, methods that developers can access from the window object.

In a synchronous language, only one thing can be done at a time. Imagine an alert on the page, blocking the user from accessing any part of the page until the OK button is clicked. If everything in JavaScript that took a significant amount of time, blocked the browser, then we would have a pretty bad user experience.

This is where `concurrency` and the `event loop` come in. When you run some JavaScript code in a browser, the engine starts to parse the code. Each line is executed and popped on and off the call stack.

Web API's are not something JavaScript recognizes, so the parser knows to pass it off to the browser for it to handle. When the browser has finished running its method, it puts what is needed to be ran by JavaScript into the callback queue. The callback queue cannot be ran until the call stack is completely empty. So, the event loop is constantly checking the call stack to see if it is empty so that it can add anything in the callback queue back into the call stack. And finally, once it is back in the call stack, it is ran and then popped off the stack.

Until 2009, JavaScript was only run inside of the browser. That is when Ryan Dahl decided it would be great if we could use JavaScript to build things outside the browser. He used C and C++ to build an executable (exe) program called `Node JS`. Node JS is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 engine that uses C++ to provide the event loop and callback queue needed to run asynchronous operations.

### ðŸ“’ Execution Context, Lexical Environment, Scope Chain, Hoisting <a name="8"></a>

Code in JavaScript is always run inside a type of execution context. `Execution context` is simply the environment within which your code is ran. There are 2 types of execution context in JavaScript, `global` or `function`. There are 2 stages as well to each context, the creation and executing phase. As the JavaScript engine starts to read your code, it creates something called the Global Execution Context.

A `lexical environment` is basically the scope or environment the engine is currently reading code in. A new lexical environment is created when curly brackets {} are used, even nested brackets {{...}} create a new lexical environment. The execution context tells the engine which lexical environment it is currently working in and the lexical scope determines the available variables.

Each environment context that is created has a link outside of its lexical environment called the `scope chain`. The scope chain gives us access to variables in the parent environment.

```javascript
function sayMyName() {
  var a = "a";
  return function findName() {
    var b = "b";
    return function printName() {
      var c = "c";
      return "String";
    };
  };
}

sayMyName()()(); //each function is returned and has to be called

// The functions only get access to the variables in their parent container, not a child. The scope chain only links down the call stack
```

`Hoisting` is the process of putting all variable and function declarations into memory during the compile phase. In JavaScript, functions are fully hoisted, var variables are hoisted and initialized to undefined, and let and const variables are hoisted but not initialized a value. Var variables are given a memory allocation and initialized a value of undefined until they are set to a value in line. So if a var variable is used in the code before it is initialized, then it will return undefined. However, a function can be called from anywhere in the code base because it is fully hoisted. If let and const are used before they are declared, then they will throw a reference error because they have not yet been initialized.

### ðŸ“’ The arguments object <a name="9"></a>

Arguments looks like an array, but it's not really an array. There are many things that you can do with the arguments keyword that might make the compiler or the JavaScript engine less able to optimize your code because you can't really use array methods on this. And with the new JavaScript, they introduced a few little tools that we can use so that we avoid using arguments, because there are some cases where we might want to iterate or loop through arguments instead of just accessing them regularly.

```javascript
function marry (person1, person2){
  console.log(arguments)
  console.log(Array.from(arguments))
  return `${person1}` is now merried with `${person2}`
}

marry ('Tim', 'Tina')

// {0: 'Tim, 1: 'Tina'}
// ['Tim', 'Tina']
```

```javascript
function marry (...args){
  console.log(args)
  console.log(Array.from(arguments))
  return `${args[0]}` is now merried with `${args[1]}`
}

marry ('Tim', 'Tina')

// ['Tim', 'Tina']
// ['Tim', 'Tina']
```

### ðŸ“’ Function Scope and Block Scope <a name="10"></a>

Most programming languages are block scoped, meaning every time you see a new { } (curly braces) is a new lexical environment.

However, JavaScript is function scoped, meaning it only creates a new local environment if it sees the keyword function on the global scope.

To give us access to block scope, in ES6 `let` and `const` were added to the language. Using these can prevent memory leaks, but there is still an argument to be made for using `var`.

```javascript
//Function Scope
function loop() {
  for (var i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
  }
  console.log("final", i); // returns final 5
}

//Block Scope
function loop2() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // can access i here
  }
  console.log("final", i); // returns an error
}

loop();
/*
  1
  2
  3
  4
  final 5
*/
loop2();
// ReferenceError: i is not defined
```

Variable declarations with let and const work differently from the var variable declaration. When a lexical scope is entered and the execution context is created, the engine allocates memory for any `var` variable in that scope and initializes it to undefined. The `let` and `const` variables only get initialized on the line they are executed on and only get allocated undefined if there is no assignment to the variable. Trying to access a `let` or `const` variable before it is declared or outside of its block without returning it will result in a Reference Error.

### ðŸ“’ IIFE <a name="11"></a>

`Immediately Invoked Function Expression` is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. Can also be referred to as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function.

```javascript
// Grouping Operator () creates a lexical scope
(function () {
  // statements
})();
// Immediately invokes the function with 2nd set of ()
```

### ðŸ“’ `this` keyword<a name="12"></a>

`this` is the object that the function is a property of (example: obj.someFunc(this))

```javascript
// Example where 'this' becomes useful and the reason that this keyword was created.
//Two main benefits of why the this keyword was created:
// 1. gives methods access to their object.
// 2. execute the same code for multiple objects

const obj = {
  name: "Veronica",
  sing: function () {
    return "lalala " + this.name;
  },
  singAgain() {
    return "lalala " + this.name + "!";
  },
  singTwo() {
    return this.sing() + "!";
  },
};
obj.sing(); // lalala Veronica
obj.singAgain(); // lalala Veronica!
obj.singTwo(); // lalala Veronica!
```

Here is `this` 4 ways:

- new keyword binding - the new keyword changes the meaning of "this" to be the object that is being created.
- implicit binding - "this" refers to the object that is calling it. It is implied, without doing anything its just how the language works.
- explicit binding - using the "bind" keyword to change the meaning of "this".
- arrow functions as methods - "this" is lexically scoped, refers to it's current surroundings and no further. However, if "this" is inside of a method's function, it falls out of scope and belongs to the window object. To correct this, you can use a higher order function to return an arrow function that calls "this".

```javascript
// new binding
function Person(name, age) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  console.log(this);
}

const person1 = new Person("person1", 55);
// this = Person { name: 'person1', age: 55 }

//implicit binding
const person = {
  name: "person",
  age: 20,
  hi() {
    console.log("hi " + this);
  },
};

person.hi();
// this = person { name: 'person', age: 20, hi(){...} }

//explicit binding
let name = "Brittney";

const person3 = {
  name: "person3",
  age: 50,
  hi: function () {
    console.log("hi " + this.name);
  }.bind(window),
};

person3.hi();
// hi Brittney
// this = window {...}

// arrow functions inside objects
const person4 = {
  name: "person4",
  age: 40,
  hi: function () {
    var inner = () => {
      console.log(this);
    };
    return inner();
  },
};

person4.hi();
// this = person4 { name: 'person4', age: 40, hi() {...} }
// if either function is changed around, it doesn't work
```
